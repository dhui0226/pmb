# Project Manager

A project board for managing tasks that utilizes the PERN stack. Users can customize boards to section off tasks based on their priority/nature.

## Motivation

I started this project to satisfy my curiosity at behind the scenes of apps that I use such as Huntr

## Project Status

The project currently has MVP features available, however I'm looking to develop it further and implement admin/team roles as well as tracking tasks for multiple projects at a time.
